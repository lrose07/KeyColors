**Key Press Color Map**

This program captures keystrokes and then creates a color tile mosaic based on what was typed. Below is an example that was generated by typing 625 characters, as a demonstration.

To run:
Open code in editor of choice and run main from Driver.java. Press the "Start Logger" button. The logger will run in 
the background. When you are finished, press the "Stop Logger" button to see your color map.

Note that the logger will continue to run after pressing "Stop" but a new capture session will begin if you press 
"Start" again. Any keystrokes made between pressing "Stop" and pressing "Start" will not be included in the new color
map, but will be captured.

_Please use caution when entering sensitive information like passwords while the logger is running, since it captures 
all keystrokes, and saves them in plain text. Future enhancements will include sensitive data handling._
